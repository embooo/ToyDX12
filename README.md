# ToyDX12
ToyDX12 is a project I work on in parallel of my internship as a graphics programmer at a game studio. <br/> 
## Aim 
Acquire a deeper understanding of low-level APIs, particularly Direct3D 12, which I found was difficult as an intern working on a multi-API production engine, where everything is abstracted. <br/>
And of course : implement cool rendering techniques !
