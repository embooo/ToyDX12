# ToyDX12
ToyDX12 is a project I work on parallel to my graphics programming internship at Virtuos. <br/> 
## Aims 
- Acquire a **deeper understanding** of low-level APIs and **Direct3D 12**, which is quite difficult when working on a multi-API production engine, where everything is abstracted. <br/>
- Continue my [OpenGL project](https://github.com/embooo/toygl) on Direct3D 12
- Have fun implementing **cool rendering techniques !**
